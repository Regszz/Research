**Ticketing System** - 
This Python code defines a system for managing support tickets. The SupportTicket class includes methods for creating tickets, showing ticket details, adding responses, processing password change requests, and reopening tickets. Each ticket is assigned a unique ID, and the class tracks the number of active and closed tickets. The SupportTicket class also includes a method for generating random passwords, which can be used when a password change request is processed.

The main function provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the support ticket system. Users can create new tickets, close tickets, process password change requests, and view all, active, or closed tickets. The system maintains a list of tickets and provides summary statistics on the number of created, active, and resolved tickets. This code demonstrates a simple console-based application for managing and tracking support tickets within an organization.

**Groccery Shopping** - 
This Python script simulates a grocery shopping experience, allowing users to select items from three categories: fruits, vegetables, and delicatessen. Each category has a predefined list of items and their prices. The script displays a main menu for the user to choose a category, and within each category, the user can select specific items. For each selected item, the script prompts the user to enter the quantity they wish to purchase. The calculate function then calculates the total cost for the selected item, updates the cart with the item and quantity, and adds the cost to the running total. The script continuously updates and displays the current total cost and items in the cart until the user decides to exit. Upon exiting, it provides a summary of the total cost and all items purchased.

**Marking System** - 
This Python script implements a simple grading system using a while True loop. It continuously prompts the user to enter a score between 1 and 100. Depending on the entered score, the script will classify it as either "Pass" (for scores 61 and above) or "Fail" (for scores 60 and below). If the user inputs a score outside the range of 1 to 100 or provides invalid input (e.g., a non-numeric value), the script responds with "Invalid mark" or an error message, respectively. The loop ensures that the user can keep entering scores without the program terminating.
