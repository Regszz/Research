**Ticketing System** - 
This Python code defines a system for managing support tickets. The SupportTicket class includes methods for creating tickets, showing ticket details, adding responses, processing password change requests, and reopening tickets. Each ticket is assigned a unique ID, and the class tracks the number of active and closed tickets. The SupportTicket class also includes a method for generating random passwords, which can be used when a password change request is processed.

The main function provides a menu-driven interface for interacting with the support ticket system. Users can create new tickets, close tickets, process password change requests, and view all, active, or closed tickets. The system maintains a list of tickets and provides summary statistics on the number of created, active, and resolved tickets. This code demonstrates a simple console-based application for managing and tracking support tickets within an organization.
